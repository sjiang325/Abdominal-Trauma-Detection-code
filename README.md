# Abdominal-Trauma-Detection-code
This project is about implementing advanced AI-based model combining 3D segmentation, 2D Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) to enhance diagnostic performance for abdominal trauma. Our model processes abdominal CT scans to provide real-time, precise assessments, thereby improving clinical decision-making and patient outcomes.
